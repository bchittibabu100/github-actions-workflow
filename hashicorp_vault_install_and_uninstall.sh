GitLab to GitHub Migration Documentation

Objectives

1. Streamlined Workflow: Centralize repositories to GitHub for better integration with existing tools like GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL.


2. Enhanced Collaboration: Leverage GitHub’s ecosystem to improve team collaboration.


3. Cost Optimization: Consolidate platform costs by retiring GitLab.


4. Security Enhancements: Utilize GitHub’s security features such as advanced vulnerability scanning and secret scanning.


5. Standardized Processes: Ensure consistency in CI/CD pipelines and repository management.

Challenges

1. Tooling Differences: Adapting workflows from GitLab CI/CD to GitHub Actions.


2. Complex Repository Structures: Migrating monorepos and large repositories with complex histories and permissions.


3. Dependency on GitLab-Specific Features: Handling features such as GitLab Pages or issues linked directly to merge requests.


4. Sensitive Data: Ensuring credentials, API tokens, and sensitive configurations are migrated securely.


5. User Adaptation: Training teams to familiarize themselves with GitHub’s interface and features.


6. Downtime Minimization: Ensuring migration causes minimal disruption to ongoing projects.


7. Integration Updates: Reconfiguring integrations such as CI/CD pipelines, webhooks, and third-party tools.

Solution Approach

1. Planning Phase:

Audit GitLab projects for size, dependencies, and CI/CD complexity.

Identify repositories to migrate and set priorities.

Design a migration timeline to minimize disruption.



2. Tool Selection:

Use tools like GitHub Enterprise Importer or scripts for automating migrations.

Utilize APIs or tools for transferring issues, merge requests, and artifacts.



3. Migration Steps:

Repositories: Mirror repositories to GitHub using tools like git push --mirror or GitHub’s importer.

CI/CD Pipelines: Translate GitLab CI/CD YAML configurations to GitHub Actions workflows.

Issues and Comments: Export issues and comments using GitLab’s API and import them into GitHub using tools like github-issues-import.

Permissions and Teams: Recreate permissions and team structures in GitHub.

Webhooks and Integrations: Update integrations to point to GitHub.



4. Testing and Validation:

Conduct dry runs to validate repositories, workflows, and permissions.

Perform test builds and deployments on GitHub Actions.

Cross-check migrated issues, comments, and metadata.



5. Training and Documentation:

Create detailed user guides for GitHub workflows.

Conduct training sessions for developers and admins.



6. Go-Live and Monitoring:

Switch development to GitHub after validation.

Monitor for issues post-migration and provide ongoing support.

Accomplishments or Benefits

1. Improved Developer Experience: Teams benefit from GitHub’s advanced tooling like Actions and Codespaces.


2. Unified Platform: Simplified repository management and reduced overhead from maintaining two platforms.


3. Security: Enhanced vulnerability scanning, secret detection, and dependency management.


4. Performance Gains: Faster CI/CD pipelines with GitHub-hosted runners and integrations.


5. Cost Savings: Eliminated costs associated with maintaining GitLab.


6. Collaboration: Seamless integration with GitHub features like pull requests and discussions.

Lessons Learnt

1. Plan Thoroughly: Detailed planning is critical to avoid overlooking dependencies or sensitive configurations.


2. Customize Workflows: GitLab pipelines cannot be directly copied; workflows must be tailored for GitHub Actions.


3. Data Fidelity: Some GitLab features (e.g., specific labels or links) may not map directly to GitHub, requiring creative workarounds.


4. Engage Teams Early: Early training and involvement reduce resistance and ensure smoother transitions.


5. Allow for Iteration: Dry runs and phased migrations are key to catching issues before full implementation.


6. Automate Wherever Possible: Automation tools save time and reduce errors during migration.
